# Progress — Ashes of Azer

## Current task
**Milestone 0.3 is COMPLETE.** Next up: **Milestone 0.4 — Save system.**
First unchecked box: "Serialize: character (level, xp, stats), gear, bag,
skill ranks, gold."

Notes for that session:
- Reality check first: several of the things 0.4 wants to serialize don't
  exist as real systems yet — there's no gear/bag/skill-rank state anywhere
  (items/skills aren't wired into gameplay, only their data exists — see the
  0.3 "deferred" list below). `player.level`/`player.xp` don't exist either
  (XP/leveling is Milestone 1.1). Serialize what's real today (position, hp,
  which zone) and design the save shape to be forward-compatible (extra
  optional fields) rather than blocking on systems that don't exist yet. If
  this feels like it's fighting the roadmap order, that's a "roadmap scope"
  question — flag it and ask rather than guessing scope down silently.
- `saveVersion` + migrations (0.4's 4th box) matters from the very first save
  format, even a minimal one — retrofitting migration support after the
  shape has changed once is much more painful than starting with it.
- Export/import as base64 (0.4's last box) is a pure, easily-testable
  function pair (encode state → string → decode → same state) — good
  Vitest coverage target.
- `GameData` (src/data/loader.ts) is content config, not save state — don't
  conflate the two. Save data is player progress; GameData is what the
  world is made of.

## Done
- **Milestone 0.3 is COMPLETE — all 5 checkboxes ticked.** All game content
  (enemies, items, affixes, skills, zones, quests, dialogue) lives in
  `/data/*.json`, validated by zod schemas at boot, failing loudly on bad
  data. Enemies are the proof: `combat.ts`'s hardcoded `ETYPES` is gone
  entirely; `WorldScene` resolves spawnable enemies by cross-referencing
  `zones.json` against `enemies.json` (`src/systems/zoneSpawns.ts`), naming
  no enemy id in code. Verified for real: added a novel "wisp" enemy (new id,
  new sprite key with no art) to the JSON only, rebuilt with zero src/
  changes, and it spawned, rendered via a fallback sprite, and dealt its
  JSON-defined damage in a live headless run — then reverted. That proof is
  now also a permanent unit test (`zoneSpawns.test.ts`), not just a one-off
  manual check.
  - Schemas (`src/data/schemas/*.ts`): one zod schema per content file,
    doubling as the TS types via `z.infer`. `items.json`'s `bases` uses
    `z.partialRecord` (zod v4) since not every slot needs base items defined
    yet. `skills.json` uses a discriminated union on `mechanic`
    (shockwave/leap/execute/buff) to capture each of the prototype's 5
    skills' per-rank scaling as data (base+perRank coefficients) ahead of
    the skill engine landing in Milestone 1.1/1.2 — skills aren't executed
    by any code yet, this is data capture only.
  - Loader (`src/data/loader.ts` + `gameData.ts`): `validateGameData()` is
    pure (takes raw parsed objects, not files) so both real content and
    hand-built bad fixtures are testable without touching disk. Aggregates
    errors across ALL 7 files before throwing — never fails on just the
    first bad file. `BootScene` halts on a full-screen itemized error
    instead of starting the game with partial/invalid content; verified by
    deliberately corrupting `enemies.json`, screenshotting the error screen,
    then reverting (confirmed via `git diff` — no residual change).
  - Content ported from the prototype: enemies (slime/bat/skel/boss — skel
    and boss aren't spawned by any scene yet, they're dungeon-only content
    waiting on 0.5), affixes (all 10 + poison flag), items (5 slots, all
    bases, 5 rarity tiers, 3 legendaries), skills (all 5 warrior skills).
    `quests.json`/`dialogue.json` are empty arrays — no prototype content
    exists for those systems (2.1/2.2 will populate them).
  - 61 total unit tests now (was 24 at the start of this session): schema
    validation (valid/invalid per file), loader aggregation/fail-loudly,
    the zero-code-changes proof, sprite fallback.
- **0.2 parity assessment** (decision on what "parity" meant for Milestone
  0.2's "port the prototype into Phaser scenes" scope, recorded for
  reference): at parity — movement/collision, camera follow, combat core
  (primary attack, damage numbers, cooldown, slime/bat chase+contact),
  fog of war, death/respawn/HUD. Deliberately deferred to their owning
  milestones (not 0.2 gaps): loot/items/affixes (0.3 — now data-complete,
  system lands in 1.x), XP/leveling (1.1), skills 1-5 (1.2), dungeon/
  skeletons/boss/map transitions (0.5), legendary powers (1.5).
- **Milestone 0.2 is COMPLETE — all 6 checkboxes ticked.** The prototype's
  core overworld gameplay now runs in Phaser (scenes, movement, camera,
  combat, fog, death/respawn), verified vs. the HTML prototype (see the parity
  assessment under Current task for the exact scope boundary).
- **Milestone 0.2, checkbox 6: fog of war.**
  - `src/systems/fog.ts` — `fogParams()` pure (radius 100/62 + vision,
    darkness 0.82/0.95) with tests; `FogOfWar` class fills a scrollFactor-0
    RenderTexture at `darkness` and erases a radial sight brush at the player
    each frame. Brush gradient tuned so erase leaves darkness*0.7 at the 0.8
    stop, matching the prototype. O(1) per frame.
  - `Player.visionBonus` stub (real +Vision stat with gear in 0.3).
  - Verified headless: bright centre (95) / dark far corner (36) sampled from
    the screenshot, ~59 fps with fog redrawing every frame (roadmap's "test
    perf early"); screenshot matches prototype look.
- **Milestone 0.2 (all 6 checkboxes) and 0.1 (all 6 checkboxes) — condensed.**
  Full session-by-session detail lives in git history (commit messages are
  thorough); kept here only what a fresh session actually needs:
  - Scenes: `BootScene` → `WorldScene` (gameplay) + `UIScene` (HUD overlay,
    launched in parallel). `main.ts` registers all three; game runs at
    **480x270 internal resolution, zoom 2** (not 960x540) so every ported
    prototype tuning value — speeds, radii, distances — carries over 1:1
    with no rescaling.
  - `src/systems/mapgen.ts`: port of the prototype's Starter Plains
    generator (60x40 tiles, 16px each). Placeholder until Tiled lands in
    0.5. Spawn point (160,496).
  - `src/systems/pixelart.ts`: GBA-palette procedural sprites + a 9-tile
    tileset strip. Now also holds `spriteRowsFor()` with a fallback sprite
    for enemy ids with no dedicated art (added in 0.3, see below).
  - `src/entities/Player.ts`: arcade body, WASD/arrows at 78px/s, `facing`
    vector (for future skill aiming), hp/dead/respawn, several gear-stat
    stubs (aspdPct, critPct, moveSpeedPct, visionBonus) waiting on 0.3's
    item system landing in gameplay (not just data — see Current task).
  - `src/entities/Enemy.ts` / `src/systems/combat.ts`: chase-and-contact AI,
    pooled damage numbers (`DamageNumbers.ts`), attack cooldown, crits. As
    of 0.3 this is fully data-driven — see the 0.3 entry above.
  - `src/systems/fog.ts`: screen-space RenderTexture fog of war, erase-brush
    sight radius, ~59fps measured with fog active.
  - `UIScene`: HP bar + "YOU DIED" overlay, reading a `hud` key WorldScene
    publishes to the registry each frame (keeps scenes decoupled).
  - `window.__AZER = { player, enemies }` is a permanent debug handle (not
    dev-gated) — used by headless smoke tests every session, and doubles as
    a head start on the 2.5 debug-tools task.
  - CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and Pages deploy
    (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) both green. Live at
    https://stevenseagalstreams.github.io/Ashes-of-azer/, deploys
    automatically on push to `dev`.

## Decisions
- Branch protection on `main` could not be configured: no branch-protection
  tool is exposed by the GitHub MCP server available in this session. Left
  for the human to enable in repo Settings → Branches (require PR review
  before merge).
- Scaffolded the Vite project by hand (package.json/tsconfig/vite.config.ts)
  rather than running the interactive `npm create vite@latest` CLI, since the
  repo already has files at root and the CLI's non-empty-directory prompt
  can't be answered non-interactively. End result is equivalent.
- Picked latest stable **TypeScript 5.9.3** over the new TypeScript 7 native
  compiler (just released) — ecosystem tooling (typescript-eslint etc.) is
  far more battle-tested on 5.x for a fresh project.
- Bumped Vite to 8.x and Vitest to 4.x (over the versions I initially
  targeted) after `npm audit` flagged moderate/high/critical dev-server-only
  vulnerabilities in the older esbuild/vite chain; latest majors resolve them
  (`npm audit` now clean).
- Deploy target: **GitHub Pages**, per user's explicit choice when asked
  (CLAUDE.md requires asking before anything "publishing"). itch.io was the
  alternative but needs a butler API key / new account setup.
- Vitest set to `passWithNoTests: true` rather than adding a placeholder test
  — there's no real logic yet to test at 0.1; real tests start with 0.3's
  data-driven systems, per CLAUDE.md's verification rules. (First real tests
  landed with mapgen in 0.2.)
- Placeholder map: ported the prototype's generator into `src/systems/mapgen.ts`
  (option "a" from last session's notes) instead of a bare bounds rectangle —
  it gives collision something real to verify against, keeps visual parity,
  and its pure functions are unit-testable. Tiled replaces it in 0.5.
- Game internal resolution set to 480x270 with zoom 2 (not 960x540 native) so
  the prototype's tuning values port 1:1 without rescaling every constant.
- `window.__AZER` debug handle is exposed unconditionally (not dev-gated):
  needed by headless smoke tests against prod builds, harmless to players,
  and a head start on the 2.5 debug-tools task.
- **0.3**: zone spawn selection is uniform-random across a zone's
  `enemyTypes` (`Phaser.Utils.Array.GetRandom`), not the prototype's
  hardcoded 70% slime / 30% bat weighting. A tuning simplification, not a
  bug — CLAUDE.md says tuning values are mine to decide. If spawn weighting
  ever matters for balance, it'd be a `weight` field added to
  `ZoneSchema.enemyTypes` (currently plain id strings).
- **0.3**: `items.json`'s `bases` uses zod v4's `z.partialRecord` instead of
  `z.record` — not every item slot needs base items defined yet (future
  slots from Milestone 4.x can be added to `slots` before any bases exist).
- **0.3**: skills.json captures per-rank scaling as data (discriminated
  union on `mechanic`) but nothing executes it yet — no code reads
  `skills.json` at runtime. That's intentional; the skill engine is
  Milestone 1.1/1.2's job. Don't be surprised skills.json looks "unused."
- **0.3**: `boss` enemies get a wider (30px vs 12px) hp bar in `Enemy.ts` —
  ported for free since the `boss` flag was already in the schema, even
  though no boss is spawned anywhere yet (dungeon lands in 0.5).

## Backlog
- Enable branch protection on `main` (human, GitHub Settings → Branches) —
  still outstanding, no tool available to me to do this.

## Needs human playtest
- ~~Movement/collision/camera feel~~ — **confirmed by user 2026-07-14**:
  walking works, trees and water block correctly.
- ~~Combat/fog/death loop~~ — **confirmed by user 2026-07-14** ("it works!").
- Nothing new to playtest from Milestone 0.3 — it's pure architecture, enemy
  behavior is identical to before the refactor (verified headless). Next
  playtest-worthy milestone is likely 1.1+ (skills become usable) or
  whenever loot starts dropping.
